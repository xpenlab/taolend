## 📖 Overview

TaoLend is a trustless peer-to-peer lending protocol on Bittensor that enables:
- **Lenders**: Earn interest on TAO while maintaining liquidity
- **Borrowers**: Access TAO liquidity using subnet ALPHA as collateral, without selling holdings

All operations are secured by smart contracts with cryptographically signed offers (EIP-712).

---

## 🔄 For Lenders

### 1️⃣ Deposit TAO

Deposit TAO into the contract. Your TAO is automatically staked to Bittensor delegate.

**Benefits**:
- ✅ TAO remains liquid and available for lending
- ✅ Withdraw unused TAO anytime (no lock-up)

---

### 2️⃣ Create Loan Offers

Create signed offers specifying your lending terms:

**Offer Parameters**:

| Parameter | Description | Constraints |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Subnet (netuid)** | Which ALPHA subnet to accept as collateral | Must be > 0 |
| **Max TAO Amount** | Total lending capacity for this offer | In RAO (9 decimals), min 1 TAO |
| **Max ALPHA Price** | Maximum ALPHA price accepted for collateral calculation | Must be < 90% of on-chain price |
| **Daily Interest Rate** | Your earnings rate | 0.01% - 1% per day |
| **Expiration** | Offer validity period | In timestamp |
| **Nonce** | Auto-incremented counter | Current lender nonce |

**⚠️ WARNING: Expiration Management**
- Setting expiration too far in the future can expose you to market risks
- Recommend setting appropriate expiration periods based on market conditions
- **Actively monitor your offers** and cancel them if market conditions change unfavorably
- Canceling offers requires an **on-chain transaction** via `cancel(offer)` or `cancel()` (increment nonce)

**Process**:
1. Sign offer using EIP-712 (cryptographic signature)
2. Offer stored in protocol database
3. No further action needed - contract executes automatically when borrower accepts

**Example**: Lend up to 500 TAO for netuid=2 ALPHA collateral at 0.5% daily interest, valid for 30 days.

---

### 3️⃣ Earn Interest

When borrowers accept your offer:
- TAO automatically transferred from your deposited balance to borrower
- Interest accrues daily: `interest = principal × days × rate / 7200 / 1e9`
- **Platform fee**: 30% of interest (not principal)

**Example Earnings**:
- Loan: 300 TAO at 0.5%/day for 10 days
- Total interest: 15 TAO
- Platform fee: 4.5 TAO (30%)
- **Your earnings: 10.5 TAO**

---

### 4️⃣ Manage Loans

**Request Repayment**:
- Available after 3-day minimum loan duration
- Call `collect(loanId)` to initiate collection
- Borrower has 3-day grace period to repay

**Transfer Loan**:
- Sell your loan position to another lender
- Available after 3 days (or immediately from IN_COLLECTION state)
- Receive principal + accrued interest
- Call `transfer(loanId, newOffer)`

**Seize Collateral**:
- If borrower doesn't repay within grace period
- Call `seize(loanId)` to claim ALPHA collateral
- Available 3 days after collection

---

### 5️⃣ Cancel Offers

**Cancel Specific Offer**:
- Call `cancel(offer)` with offer details

**Cancel All Offers**:
- Call `cancel()` to increment nonce
- Invalidates all existing offers instantly

---

### 6️⃣ Withdraw TAO

Withdraw unused TAO anytime (only TAO not currently lent out).

---

## 🔐 For Borrowers

**⚠️ IMPORTANT PREREQUISITE**: Before borrowing, you **MUST** deposit ALPHA collateral into the contract first.

**Why Deposit is Required**:
- The contract needs to lock your ALPHA as collateral when you borrow
- ALPHA must already be in the contract before calling the `borrow()` function
- This ensures atomic loan execution and collateral security

---

### 1️⃣ Accept Loan Offer

Find a lender's offer and accept it:

**Requirements**:
- Valid signed offer from lender
- Minimum loan amount: 1 TAO
- Sufficient ALPHA collateral: `alphaAmount × offerPrice / 1e9 ≥ taoAmount`
- Lender has available TAO balance
- Offer not expired or canceled

**Process**:
- Call `borrow(offer, taoAmount, alphaAmount)`
- Contract validates all conditions
- ALPHA collateral automatically locked
- TAO instantly transferred to your wallet

---

### 2️⃣ Repay Loan

Repay anytime:

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Before repaying, you **MUST** deposit sufficient TAO into the contract first using `depositTao()`. The contract requires TAO to be available in your internal balance (`userAlphaBalance[msg.sender][0]`) to process repayment.

**Repayment Amount**:
```
Elapsed Blocks = Current Block - Start Block
Interest = (Principal × Elapsed Blocks × Daily Rate) / (7200 × 1e9)
Total = Principal + Interest

Or expressed in days:
Days = Elapsed Blocks / 7200
Interest = (Principal × Days × Daily Rate) / 1e9
```

**Upon Repayment**:
- ✅ ALPHA collateral immediately released
- ✅ Loan state becomes REPAID

**Third-Party Repayment**:
- Anyone can repay your loan
- Collateral returns to you (original borrower)

---

### 3️⃣ Refinance Loan

Switch to a better offer anytime:

**Process**:
- Call `refinance(loanId, newOffer, newTaoAmount)`
- Old loan repaid (principal + interest)
- New loan created with same collateral
- All in one atomic transaction

**Scenarios**:

**Borrow Less**: Pay difference in TAO ⚠️ *Requires TAO deposited in contract*
```
Old: 300 TAO owed (315 after interest)
New: 250 TAO
→ Pay 65 TAO difference (must have sufficient TAO balance in contract)
```

**Borrow More**: Receive additional TAO
```
Old: 300 TAO owed (315 after interest)
New: 400 TAO
→ Receive 85 TAO (400-315)
```

**Same Amount, Better Rate**: Reduce future interest costs
```
Old: 0.5%/day → New: 0.3%/day
```

---

### 4️⃣ Handle Collection

If lender calls `collect()`:

**Your Options**:
1. **Repay**: Pay principal + interest, get collateral back
2. **Refinance**: Switch to new lender with better terms
3. **Wait**: 3-day grace period before seizure

**Default Consequence**:
- After 3 days, lender can call `seize()`
- All ALPHA collateral transferred to lender
- No further obligation

---

### 5️⃣ Withdraw ALPHA (Optional)

After repaying all loans, withdraw unused ALPHA.

**Important Notes**:
- ⚠️ **EVM-Generated Coldkey Required**: The registered SS58 coldkey address MUST be EVM-generated. Using a non-EVM coldkey may result in withdrawal failures or fund loss.
- **Default Behavior**: `withdrawAlpha` transfers assets to your registered EVM-generated coldkey address by default.

---

## 📊 Loan Lifecycle

![Loan State Diagram](docs/LoanState.png)

**States**:

| State | Description | Duration |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **OPEN** | Active loan, interest accruing | Minimum 3 days for lender actions |
| **IN_COLLECTION** | Lender requested repayment | 3-day grace period |
| **REPAID** | Successfully repaid | Final state ✓ |
| **CLAIMED** | Collateral seized | Final state ✓ |
| **RESOLVED** | Emergency resolution by manager | Final state ⚠️ |

**Key Transitions**:
- **Borrower can repay anytime**; After 3 days: Lender can collect or transfer
- **IN_COLLECTION**: Borrower can repay; Anyone can transfer; Lender can seize (after 3 days)
- **RESOLVED**: Emergency state when subnet is disabled - manager returns assets to both parties

---

## 📋 Additional Important Notes

### 1. Subnet Deregistration Detection

A subnet is considered **deregistered** when:

**Criteria**: Both `alpha_in_pool` and `alpha_out_pool` fall below **15 days of emission**

**Calculation**:
```
Emission threshold = 15 days × daily emission rate
If (alpha_in_pool < threshold) AND (alpha_out_pool < threshold):
    → Subnet is deregistered
```

**Why 15 days**: This threshold ensures:
- Normal market fluctuations don't trigger false deregistration
- Genuine subnet shutdowns are detected promptly
- Sufficient time buffer to distinguish temporary vs permanent issues

**What happens next**: Once detected, the manager can begin resolving affected loans and ALPHA positions.

---

### 2. Subnet Deregistration and Resolution

In rare cases where a subnet is disabled or deregistered from Bittensor, the protocol manager can manually resolve affected loans using the `resolveLoan()` function.

**When It's Used**:
- Subnet is disabled on the protocol
- Subnet has low ALPHA in pool (most staked ALPHA already withdrawn)
- Loan is in OPEN or IN_COLLECTION state

**What Happens**:
1. Manager calls `resolveLoan(loanId, lenderAmount, borrowerAmount)`
2. Lender receives `lenderAmount` TAO (principal + partial interest compensation)
3. Borrower receives `borrowerAmount` TAO (partial collateral value compensation)
4. Collateral is released from subnet
5. Loan moves to RESOLVED terminal state

**Purpose**:
- Protects both parties when subnet becomes unusable
- Ensures fair distribution of available assets
- Prevents funds from being locked indefinitely
- Maintains protocol integrity during emergencies

**Note**: This is a rare administrative action only used when normal loan operations cannot proceed due to external subnet issues.

---

### 3. Asset Distribution During Resolution

When a subnet is deregistered, the manager resolves loans and ALPHA using assets obtained from unstaking the deregistered subnet's ALPHA collateral.

**Resolution Process**:

1. **Unstake ALPHA**: Manager unstakes deregistered ALPHA from the subnet, receiving TAO in return
2. **Calculate Available TAO**: Contract balance = unstaked TAO from deregistered ALPHA
3. **Distribute to Loans**: For each affected loan, manager calls `resolveLoan(loanId, lenderAmount, borrowerAmount)`:

**Distribution Priority**:

**First Priority - Lender**:
- ✅ Full principal repayment
- ✅ Accrued interest (if sufficient TAO available)
- Lender receives `lenderAmount` TAO

**Second Priority - Borrower**:
- ✅ Remaining TAO (if any after lender is paid)
- Represents partial compensation for lost collateral
- Borrower receives `borrowerAmount` TAO

**Example Resolution**:
```
Loan: 100 TAO principal, 10 TAO interest accrued
Collateral: 5000 ALPHA → unstaked for 120 TAO

Distribution:
- Lender receives: 110 TAO (principal + interest)
- Borrower receives: 10 TAO (remaining balance)
```

**Fair Distribution**:
- Manager determines appropriate split based on:
  - Loan principal and interest owed
  - Available TAO from unstaked ALPHA
  - Protocol fairness guidelines
- Goal: Minimize losses for both parties proportionally

**ALPHA Resolution**:
- Deposited ALPHA (not in loans) is also resolved similarly
- Users receive TAO compensation based on available contract balance
- Manager ensures fair distribution across all affected positions

---

### 4. Third-Party Repayment

**Anyone can repay a loan on behalf of the borrower**:
- ⚠️ The repayer must first deposit sufficient TAO into the contract using `depositTao()`
- The repayer pays both principal and accrued interest
- Collateral is returned to the **original borrower** (not the repayer)
- This allows friends, family, or liquidation services to help borrowers avoid collateral seizure
- The repayer receives no direct benefit except helping the borrower

**Example**: Alice borrows 100 TAO with ALPHA collateral. Bob (a friend) can repay Alice's 110 TAO debt, and Alice receives her ALPHA back.

---

### 5. Transfer Interest Rate Limit (IN_COLLECTION State)

When a loan is in **IN_COLLECTION** state:
- **Anyone can transfer the loan** to a new lender (not just the current lender)
- **Interest rate protection**: The new offer's daily interest rate can be at most **50% higher** than the current offer
- **Purpose**: Protects borrowers from predatory rates during distressed situations
- **Example**:
  - Current offer: 0.5% daily interest
  - Maximum allowed new rate: 0.75% daily interest (0.5% × 1.5)

This prevents exploitation while still allowing market-based loan transfers during collection.

---

### 6. Uncontrollable Risk: Subnet Transfer Restrictions

**Risk**: Subnet owners have the power to disable ALPHA transfers by setting `transfers_enabled = false`.

**Impact on Users**:

**If `transfers_enabled` is set to `false` AFTER you deposit ALPHA**:
- ✅ **Lending continues**: Your deposited ALPHA can still be used as collateral for new loans
- ✅ **Existing loans unaffected**: Ongoing loans continue normally
- ✅ **Borrowing works**: Borrowers can still accept offers using your ALPHA
- ❌ **Withdrawals blocked**: You CANNOT withdraw your ALPHA to your wallet
- ⏳ **Temporary restriction**: Withdrawals remain blocked until the subnet owner re-enables transfers (`transfers_enabled = true`)

**Why This Happens**:
- Subnet owners control transfer permissions at the network level
- This is a Bittensor network feature, not a protocol decision
- The protocol cannot override subnet-level restrictions

**Protection Measures**:
- Monitor subnet governance and owner policies
- Diversify across multiple subnets to reduce concentration risk
- Only deposit ALPHA from subnets with reliable, transparent governance
- Check subnet `transfers_enabled` status before depositing

**Important**: This is an **uncontrollable external risk** inherent to Bittensor's subnet architecture. Users should evaluate subnet governance quality before depositing significant ALPHA amounts.

---

### 7. EVM-Generated Coldkey Registration Requirement

**Critical Requirement**: The registered SS58 coldkey address **MUST** be EVM-generated.

**Why This Matters**:
- ⚠️ **Using a non-EVM coldkey may result in withdrawal failures or fund loss**
- The protocol relies on EVM-to-SS58 address mapping for secure asset transfers
- Non-EVM coldkeys may not have valid reverse mappings, causing transaction failures

**How It Works**:
- When you register, your SS58 coldkey is linked to your EVM address
- `withdrawAlpha()` transfers assets to your registered coldkey by default
- The coldkey must be derivable from an EVM address for transfers to succeed

**How to Generate EVM-Compatible Coldkey**:
1. Generate an EVM private key (32-byte hex)
2. Derive the EVM address (H160) from the private key
3. Convert the EVM address to SS58 format using the Bittensor subnet ID
4. Use this SS58 address as your coldkey when registering

**Verification**:
- Before registering, verify your coldkey is EVM-generated
- Test with small amounts first
- Ensure you control the EVM private key that generates the coldkey

**Important**: Never use coldkeys from non-EVM wallets (e.g., Polkadot.js native keys) for registration, as this may result in **permanent fund loss** during withdrawals.

### 8. Technical Implementation Details

This section explains critical technical design decisions in the smart contract implementation.

#### 8.1 ALPHA Deposit Implementation (`depositAlpha`)

**Why `delegatecall` is Used**:

The `_depositAlpha()` function uses `delegatecall` for the first `transferStake` operation (Line 993 in LendingPoolV2.sol):

```solidity
(bool transferSuccess, ) = address(staking).delegatecall(transferData);
```

**This is intentional design**, not a bug:

- `delegatecall` executes the precompiled contract code in the **caller's context** (msg.sender)
- This allows the contract to transfer ALPHA stake **from the user's account** to the contract's coldkey
- Without `delegatecall`, the contract cannot access the user's staked ALPHA on the Bittensor network
- This enables accurate accounting of deposited amounts: ALPHA is transferred from user → contract coldkey, then moved to DELEGATE_HOTKEY

**Two-Step Process**:
1. **First call (delegatecall)**: Transfer stake from user's account to contract coldkey (uses user's permissions)
2. **Second call (call)**: Move stake from contract coldkey to DELEGATE_HOTKEY (uses contract's permissions)

The second operation uses `call` because it moves stake within the contract's own holdings (from one hotkey to another).

---

#### 8.2 Protocol Fee Accounting (`protocolFeeAccumulated`)

**How Protocol Fees Work**:

`protocolFeeAccumulated` is a **pure accounting variable** that tracks protocol fees owed to the platform. It does NOT represent separate funds - the fees are already part of the contract's total balance.

**Accounting Flow**:

When users repay loans in `repay()`, `transfer()`, or `refinance()`:

1. Full `repayAmount` is deducted from borrower's balance
2. Only `repayAmount - protocolFee` is credited to the lender
3. The difference (`protocolFee`) stays within the contract's total balance
4. `protocolFeeAccumulated` increases to track this fee (accounting entry only)

**Why `subnetAlphaBalance[0]` is NOT increased**:

- The protocol fee is **already accounted for** in the system through the deduction
- It was never removed from the contract's total balance
- Increasing `subnetAlphaBalance[0]` would count it twice

**Mathematical Invariant**:
```
sum(userAlphaBalance[user][0]) + protocolFeeAccumulated = subnetAlphaBalance[0]
```

This ensures:
- User balances + accumulated fees = total TAO pool balance
- When `withdrawProtocolFees()` is called, both `protocolFeeAccumulated` and `subnetAlphaBalance[0]` decrease
- The invariant is maintained throughout all operations

---

#### 8.3 CONTRACT_COLDKEY Initialization

**Why Two-Step Initialization is Required**:

`CONTRACT_COLDKEY` cannot be set in the constructor because it must be **derived from the contract's EVM address**.

**The Problem**:
- The SS58 coldkey address can only be generated **after** the contract is deployed
- During constructor execution, the contract address is not yet finalized
- The coldkey derivation requires the deployed contract's EVM address as input

**Protection Mechanisms**:
- ✅ Can only be called once (checks `CONTRACT_COLDKEY == bytes32(0)`)
- ✅ Only owner can call (onlyOwner modifier)
- ✅ Cannot be set to zero address (checks `_coldkey != bytes32(0)`)

**This is not a design flaw** - it's a necessary consequence of the EVM-to-Substrate address mapping architecture in Bittensor's Frontier implementation.
